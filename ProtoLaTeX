\section{Q6A: Lucky Streaks}
In this section, we aim to use computational methods in order to find a solution to the following problem: 
\begin{quote}
Toss a fair coin a large number $N$ times and find the longest streak of successive heads. So if the outcomes are HHTHTTHTHHHHTTHHHTH then the streak length is 4.
\end{quote}

	\subsubsection{Matlab Plot and comparison with upper bound}
Let $A$ be the event there is a streak of length $k$ or more in the first $N$ tosses. Then, $A=\bigcup _{n=1} ^N {A_n}$, where $A_n$ represents the event that a streak of length $k$ starts at toss number $n$. Since $P[A_k]=(\frac{1}{2})^k$, we have the upper bound $P[A] \leq N(\frac{1}{2})^k$.
\\
We now compare the accuracy of this upper bound, for various values of k, with our data.
